# Helios II
This is the flight computer software for my UAV, the Helios II. It's the spiritual successor to NASA's experimental aircraft HELIOS which had a potential misison of flying to 100,000ft. The plan for Helios II is to reach this same goal with modern technology, and implement features for deployment on Mars.
